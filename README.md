## Update: I've migrated to Squarespace, this is no longer in use.


*This is my website. There are many like it, but this one is mine.*

## Setup

``` bash
$ nvm use # Fetch the right node version
$ make    # install deps, lint, build static assets
```

## Dev
```bash
$ yarn dev # serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
```

## Generate static website
```bash
$ make build # output goes to dist/
```

## Deploy
Whatever tickles your fancy for deploying a static website. I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 🤷🏾‍♂️
